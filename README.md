Welcome!
Thanks for stopping by!

All of my repositories are currently set to private due to academic integrity and privacy considerations. However, I’m happy to share examples of my work upon request — including projects in:

- Full-Stack Web Development (React, Node.js, MongoDB)
- Object-Oriented Programming (C++, Python)
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Smart Contract Development (Solidity)
- DevOps & Cloud Tools (AWS, GitHub Actions)

If you're an employer, recruiter, or collaborator and would like access to specific projects, feel free to email me or connect with me on LinkedIn.

Thanks again for visiting!
